//! The alert: a failure that already happened and has to be read.
//!
//! It exists because the alternative is `set_status`, which clears itself after
//! `STATUS_TTL` and is wiped by the next redraw. That is fine for "saved" and
//! wrong for "ssh could not be run": a screen that comes back unchanged reads
//! as a keypress that did nothing, and the one thing the user needed was the
//! sentence the program printed just before we drew over it.
//!
//! Yellow, not red: it has already happened, and reading it costs nothing. Red
//! is reserved for a gate in front of something about to be lost.
